= Can I style the dropdowns and output different? =

Yes, the plugin includes dbp-scripts.css file that provides the ability to change the look and feel of the dropdown box/sections and output.

= Why is the javascript file that does all of the API call being kept on your website? =

I decided to keep the javascript file that the plugin calls to retrieve all of the data on my website. This will then allow me to update and improve how the interactions work between the javascript
and the DBP API, without you having to update your plugin. So, if something changes in the DBP API (another version) - I can make backward compatible changes that should not break the installed plugin.

= Where can I see the plugin demo in action? =

You can see a demo of the plugin here: http://ministrystaff.org/dbp-bible/

=Do you have sample HTML to paste into my Post or Page that will create the respective dropdowns? =

<div id="bibleTopBar">
